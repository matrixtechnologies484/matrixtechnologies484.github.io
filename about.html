			<h1>Hello!</h1><br>
		<p>I am Mithulesh Parthasarathy a.k.a matrix (formerly WinMithul).</p>

<p>I am a Bengaluru-based Video Developer. Born In Tamil Nadu, and brought up in Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.</p>

<p>Just 20 years old, Been in GameMaker for 7 years,</p>

<p>Finished Grade 12 last year.</p>

<p>My main hobby is to make games.</p>
		
<p>I started making games at the age of 6. I used to make games in PowerPoint. And then in 2016, when I was 12, I started making games with Game Maker. I even started learning other programming languages like Python, C++, and C#.</p>

<p>Most of my games are inspired by the previous century's era when games are 8 and 16 bit.</p>

<p>I kept on making games and struggled to balance my studies and swimming also.</p>

<p>I had the intention to add interesting visuals and gameplay.</p>
		
<p>Another hobby of mine is making music.</p>

<p>I love making music. Music is always my favourite.<br>
I primarily make music in fl studio.<br>
I make experimental music inspired by 90s- early 2000s.</p>

<p>Also, art is my hobby. But I rarely make art. That too mostly drawing characters. Or designing characters for my game.</p>
		
<p>And last, Swimming is my main sport.</p>	
<p>I used to do swimming since when I was 6 years and competitive level when I was 11 but unfortunately, I stopped swimming since last year due to other works.</p>
<p>In January of last year, I had participated in CBSE Nationals in Swimming and got 2 medals. Bronze and Silver. This was the last competition I had participated</p>
		
<p>My main Ambition is to become a solo indie dev and I wanted to add cool and amazing visuals, gameplay, and many useful features to my game.<br> OR, I was thinking to become a software engineer/developer.<br><br>Thank You!</p>
